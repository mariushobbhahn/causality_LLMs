# causality_LLMs

We play around with different tasks revolving around causality in LLMs like GPT-3. Our goal is to measure the quality of its causal modelling capabilities in real-world tasks, toy problems and adversarial examples

Some of the tasks have been taken from big bench.
TODO: explain which ones. 

The project is currently very experimental. Future versions will include better code and documentation. 

The data cleaning notebook is used to prepare the bigbench problems in a useful format

The create ball toy problems is used to create toy problems with the ball example

The playground gpt3 notebook is used to get gpt3 to answer some questions.
