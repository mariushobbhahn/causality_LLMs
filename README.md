# causality_LLMs
We play around with different tasks revolving around causality in LLMs like GPT-3. Our goal is to measure the quality of its causal modelling capabilities in real-world tasks, toy problems and adversarial examples

Some of the tasks have been taken from big bench.
TODO: explain which ones.
