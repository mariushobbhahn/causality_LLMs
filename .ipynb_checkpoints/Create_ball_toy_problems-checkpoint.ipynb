    "\n",
    "We create a toy problem with balls that hit each other in a sequential manner until one of them goes into the hole, e.g. \"The red ball hit the blue ball. The blue ball hit the green ball. The green ball fell into the hole\". \n",
    "We check if the LLM can recreate the correct sequence by asking questions such as \"which ball started the chain\" or \"which ball was second in the chain\". \n",
    "To increase complexity we will permute the order in which the sentence is presented, e.g. \"The blue ball hit the green ball. The red ball hit the blue ball. The green ball fell into the hole\". "
