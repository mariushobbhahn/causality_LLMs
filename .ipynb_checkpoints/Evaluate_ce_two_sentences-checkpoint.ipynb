    "Problem: there are many ways to give a correct answer and it's not easy to find all of them. \n",
    "Our rules:\n",
    "- If only the correct sentence is repeated it counts as a correct answer\n",
    "- If any other sentence is added it counts as an incorrect answer\n",
    "- If the model says \"the first sentence\" or \"the second sentence\" it counts as true if it refers to the correct sentence\n",
    "- Stuff like \"the sentence with the child\" does not count because it is too hard to evaluate automatically, even if a human could understand it as referring to the correct answer. \n",
